# Amazon S3 â€“ Website Hosting

## What is S3?
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a fully managed object storage service that allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time.  

- Stores files like images, documents, backups, and static websites  
- Highly durable, scalable, and secure

## My Work on S3

During the **Alpha Capsule Course (AWS)**, I practiced:

1. **Creating an S3 Bucket**
   - Named the bucket uniquely  
   - Selected the appropriate AWS Region  
   - Configured versioning and encryption (as needed)  
   - Set permissions to allow website hosting for practice  

2. **Uploading Files**
   - Uploaded HTML, CSS, and image files for a static website  
   - Organized files into folders for easy access  

3. **Static Website Hosting**
   - Enabled **Static Website Hosting** in the bucket properties  
   - Configured **Index Document** (index.html)  
   - Configured **Error Document** (error.html)  

4. **Access**
   - Practiced accessing the website via the S3 endpoint  
   - Note: Endpoint may not be publicly accessible; screenshots included instead
